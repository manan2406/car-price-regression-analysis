# Car Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict car prices using regression analysis. The data has been analyzed and visualized to understand the impact of various features on price. Visualizations include:

- Histograms and box plots for quantitative data
- Feature comparisons such as price vs. horsepower, and city vs. highway MPG
- Dynamic filters for visualizations, allowing feature-specific analysis for customers

## Files
- `car_price_regression_analysis.xlsx`: Contains all data, visualizations, and dynamic filtering.

## How to Use
